    <p>When it comes to individual foods, Venezuela is likely <strong> known for its arepas</strong>. When it comes to composed dishes, it’s pabellón criollo. This dish in its purest form is made up of four components: pulled beef, black beans, plantains and rice. You can supplement with seared queso duro (hard cheese), eggs, avocado slices and, of course, arepas. It is without question my favorite meal as well as the meal that reminds me most of home. </p>

    <h3>For the Beef:</h3>
    <img src="https://unboundwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shredded_beef_5.jpg" alt="shredded beef from unboundwellness" width="320">
    <ol>

     <li>Place the meat in a pot.</li>
     <li>Add the pieces of onion, carrot, celery (celery), the chopped peppers and the bunches of cilantro and parsley.</li>
     <li>Cover with water, cover the pot and cook for an hour and a half over medium heat. If you have a pressure cooker, cook for about 40 minutes.</li>
     <li>Remove the meat from the pot and let it rest for about 5 minutes before shredding it. With the help of two forks, shred the still hot meat into thin and long strands.</li>
     <li>In a frying pan, brown the onion and garlic cut into brunoises in olive oil until they are translucent.
    </li>
    <li>Add cumin, curry, ground paprika and stir.</li>
    <li>Add a little of the meat broth.</li>
    <li>Add the shredded meat, the julienned bell peppers or sweet peppers and the chopped tomato, and mix all the ingredients. If you see that the meat is a bit dry, add more broth.
    </li>
    <li>Let cook covered and over low heat for about 15 minutes so that all the flavors mingle. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and chili flakes to taste.</li>
    <li>When you are ready to serve, adjust the seasonings to your liking.</li>


    </ol>

    <h3>For the Black Beans:</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>Sort the black beans eliminating all impurities, pebbles and grains in poor condition. In a large container, wash them very well under running water and discard any grains that float.</li>
    <li>Put the black beans in a large pot, add the water, the bay leaves and cook them over medium heat for 1 hour and a half or until you see that the beans are soft. It is possible that foam forms on top of the water, remove it carefully so that it does not overflow. If you have a pressure cooker, cook for 35-40 minutes. Open the pressure cooker when it is cold and all the pressure has escaped from it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Abuela's Sofrito for the Black Beans:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut the paprika, onion and garlic cloves into pieces.</li>
        <li>Put them in a blender glass and blend.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, ground cumin, ground sweet paprika, salt and pepper to taste and continue grinding.</li>
        <li>Place this sauce in a pot with a lid and cook for about fifteen minutes over low heat.</li>
        <li>After the time, turn off the burner and reserve.</li>
        <li>Once the grain has softened, add the sofrito to the beans and cook over low heat for about 30 more minutes so that the broth thickens a bit, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to your liking.</li>
        <li>Black beans can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.</li>

    </ol>
