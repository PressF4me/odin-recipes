    <p>Tajadas are slices of plantains that are fried.   They are served usually as a side, and they are also used to make other dishes like plantain desserts.   They are also a part of the traditional Venezuelan dish, the <strong><a href="pabellon-criollo.html">“Pabellón Criollo”</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Ripe/yellow plantain
</li>
<li>1 Cup vegetable oil – or as needed (for frying)</li>
<li>Shredded hard white cheese (Queso llanero)</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Pour the vegetable oil in a large enough pan and turn on the stove to medium heat, so the oil starts heating up while you prepare the plantains.</li>
    <li>Cut the two ends of the plantain and make an incision with a knife along the side.</li>
    <li>Remove the skin.</li>
    <li>Cut the plantain in half.   You can make a straight/down the middle kind of cut, like I did here, or a slanted cut to have more oval like tajadas instead of what I did, which are more rectangular Tajadas.</li>
    <li>Now make about 4 slices out of each side of the plantain by slicing them sideways, to form slices of about 0.25 – 0.75 inches.   Don’t make them thicker than that.</li>

    <li>Lay the plantains on the frying pan and begin to fry them until they are golden brown, turning them if necessary, to fry both sides equally. It took me about 2 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Remove the tajadas from the pan one by one and lay on top of a paper towel to remove the excess oil.</li>
