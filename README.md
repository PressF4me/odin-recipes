# odin-recipes
First Odin Project without much hand holding.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time it is finished but it’s important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to build HTML chops;This project in the future to style it up with CSS.
